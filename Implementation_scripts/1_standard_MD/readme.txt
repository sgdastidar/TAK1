CONTENTS:

This folder contains the NAMD input files for heating, equilibration and the first and last 20ns production runs for one of the 400ns, independent trajectories of TTBIN system. 
All standard MD simulations have been run using the same set of scripts. Some specimen log files are also attached.

NOTE: 
-> The input coordinates (.crd and .psf files) of the simulations of the four systems (i.e. TTBIN, TTBOT, TAKIN and TAKOT) can be found in the Supporting Information (SI). 
-> The input files have been assigned a common name i.e. step3_pbcsetup.crd and step3_pbcsetup.psf for convenience of usage within the common scripts in separate folders. 
-> For each system, three heating input scripts were prepared with different seed values to allow sampling along three independent paths.
