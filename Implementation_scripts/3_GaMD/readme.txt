CONTENT:

This folder contains NAMD input files for short 10ns pre-GaMD equilibration, 30ns GaMD equilibration and first and last 20ns GaMD production runs of the total 100ns. Some log files are also attached.

NOTE: The same set of scripts were used for all 10 simulations i.e. 5 trajectory sets (from TMD derived equidistant structures) for each of the two pathways (with and without TBCTD).
         Any exception, however, is cited within the script as also the main manuscript.
